# Longboard_Headlights
Headlights and Taillights for Longboard project

####Headlight Module:

3x White 2W LED's w/ brightness control 

####Taillight Module:

2x Red 2W LED's w/ brightness control
1x Yellow 2W LED w/ brightness control

Each module can be controlled externally using a DC or PWM signal, or through the option of the onboard voltage divider (much less control)
Both require ~3W@12V 

Two modules in front and two in the rear. Rear modules will allow for turn signal capability as the yellow LED is driven seperately from the red LED.
These should end up being plenty bright for use
